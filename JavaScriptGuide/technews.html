            Earlier today, we attended a JavaScript programming competition, where it looked like this might be a close battle, but Nick got the upper hand quickly and never looked back.
            <p>John started writing some strange code and put everything into the global scope, while Nick was busy building objects, using inheritance, and optimizing his code until he had a very slick, clean application.  John's app, on the other hand, just seemed clunky and buggy in comparison.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it was an off day for John, but now he can sit back and watch as the remaining coders go toe to toe.  We will write up another report once we see the next showdown!</p>

        <div id="statsdiv" class="spart">
            App. Loading Speed: Nick 0.002 ms, John 3043.231 ms
            <p>Globals: Nick 1, John 137</p>
            <p>JS File Size: Nick 0.5K, John 1.2 MB</p>
            <p>Final Score: Nick 15298, John: 12</p>

        H31loW0rlD:  Is it any wonder John lost with all of those globals?
        Really, John?  REALLY?
        <p>Anne: I saw this coming.  Honestly, Nick is just better.</p>
        <p>Paul: John, I know the challenge had to do with balloons, but to even be in this competition you should know better than to overwrite the pop() method on the Array prototype! Wow!</p>
        <p>Sup3rCod3r: This was a schooling.  I hope John learns from this...</p>
        <p>Con5pir@cy: I think the competition is rigged... can't you all see it?</p>
        <p>Doug: @Con5pir@cy or whatever- See what?  It looked to me like one was just a better programmer than the other, John actually used this line while 1 == true) { alert('True'); }; ! The judges had to reboot!</p>
        <p>Christie: Yikes!  How did John fall into that trap?!</p>
        <p>Z25S1L0O: Has the video been posted yet?  I've gotta see this!  lol!</p>
